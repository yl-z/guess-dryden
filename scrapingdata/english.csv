line1363,,,,,,,,,,,,His manly Soul with more Compassion melt.
line1364,,,,,,,,,,,,"When, casting down a casual Glance, he spy'd"

line1366,,,,,,,,,,,,The fatal Spoils which haughty Turnus tore
line1367,,,,,,,,,,,,"From dying Pallas, and in Triumph wore."
line1368,,,,,,,,,,,,"Then rowz'd anew to Wrath, he loudly cries,"
line1369,,,,,,,,,,,,"(Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his Eyes:)"
